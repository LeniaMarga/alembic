- **Progressive enhancement** — everyone should get the best experience possible for them.
- **Embrace the platform** — the web is made up of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, use each for their own strengths
- **Users first** — deliver the best experience to the users of your software, don't compromise it for developer experience
- **For everyone** — build experiences for everyone who visits your website and consider disabilities
- **Local** — built by and for Open Lab, we don't need every silicon-valley super-cool feature
