# Naming conventions

**goal**

Whats the best way to use customise components of the system
and how should those customisations be named.

- Naming components is about **logic** and **clarity**, not originality
- Naming is important to create a common language in a team, to transform abstract ideas into tangible ones and keep alignment between design and code.
- Best practices are:
  - **Logical** - Components are described clearly using names that represent the thing they're naming.
    e.g. sidebar is the bar down the side of a page.
  - **Scalable** - Find names that allow permutations and leave space for future additions.
    e.g. T-shirt sizes S, M, L, XL, "M" will be the most used size but there is space on each end for smaller and larger variations.
  - **Simple** - Keep names short and basic, 1-2 words.
    If more are needed categorisation / namespacing can be employed. e.g. `Buttons / Primary` or `--color-successBorder`.
  - **Standardised** - Use names people are already familiar with and in use elsewhere.
    For component names, look up [uiguideline.com](https://www.uiguideline.com/components)
    and [component.gallery](https://component.gallery/).
- The rest of the post is more about naming ui components, which isn't the goal here.
