Alembic was made to promote the best-practises we've used and developed over the years. The web is ever-changing so the practises should too. If you've go something you think should be a part of Alembic, something you feel is missing or something you don't think is right, [open up an issue](https://github.com/digitalinteraction/alembic/issues/new) and start a discussion.
