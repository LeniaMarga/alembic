      <strong>Field</strong> is the bread and butter of a form, so it is
      important to get right. It <strong>Must</strong> have a label to prompt
      the field to be filled in. It can have a hint too, when the label needs
      more explanation. It may have a <code>placeholder</code> but it isn't
      advised, an empty-box is more enticing to fill in.
